# Natours

A Node Project to practice (JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, RESTful APIs, NoSQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, Authentication & Authorization, JWT, and Server-side rendering)

A dynamic and user-friendly tours management and booking web application that empowers administrators with CRUD operations on tours, users, reviews, and bookings granting complete control over the content. Users can easily book tours and share feedback through reviews.

During this project, I did:
- Designed and implemented REST API using Node.js and Express.js framework.
- Designed a NoSQL database and used MongoDB for data storage.
- Implemented database schema using Mongoose as ODM library.
- Implemented user authentication and authorization using JWT, enhancing the security of user accounts and access control.
- Developed a dynamic and intuitive user interface that allows users to easily browse and book tours, providing a seamless booking experience using pug templates.
- implemented credit card payment functionality with Stripe, enabling users to book tours online.
